The dollar held steady near a two-year low.Technology and travel stocks were among the biggest decliners in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, with Deutsche Lufthansa AG falling 6% amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases. IT services firm Netcompany Group A\/S slumped more than 8% after a downbeat earnings report. On the plus side, luxury goods maker Cie Financiere Richemont SA surged as much as 12% after sales rebounded in China.Contracts on the S\u0026P 500 retreated after the underlying index climbed almost 2% Thursday, heading for its best week since April. Futures on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is up over 9% this week, also declined. Treasuries were little changed after Federal Reserve officials kept interest rates near zero on Thursday and ahead of U.S. payrolls data later on Friday.Votes are still being tallied in a handful of key U.S. states, with Democrat Joe Biden taking the lead in Georgia, one of a handful of key states in which he needs just one win to unseat President Donald Trump. The president, however, questioned the credibility of the election, raising the prospect of a long stalemate as he challenges the results. Meanwhile, Republicans seem set to retain control of the Senate after also making inroads in the House.\u201cThe market reaction to the unfolding election news suggests that financial markets would prefer to see a constrained Biden presidency,\u201d said Paul O\u2019Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson Investors. \u201cThe economic backdrop to this election is one of an incomplete global recovery that remains threatened by the continued spread of Covid-19 in many major economies as well as fast-fading fiscal support measures.\u201cThe U.S. became the first country to top 100,000 coronavirus infections in a single day. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that mounting infection rates are a risk to the recovery. Meanwhile, France warned of a \u201cviolent\u201d second wave as it joined European countries including Italy and Poland in reporting new highs in daily infections.Elsewhere, crude oil declined and gold was steady.

The underlying S\u0026P 500 jumped more than 1% for a fourth consecutive day on Thursday, heading for the best week since April.The market appears to be experiencing some profit taking after rallying this week, according to Jingyi Pan, a strategist at IG Asia Pte.

Trump has 214.Biden needs only to win an additional outstanding state, such as Nevada where he is leading, or Georgia, where his campaign believes absentee votes will push him over the top.Biden said he expects to prevail. \u201cI\u2019m not here to declare that we\u2019ve won, but I am here to report that when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners,\u201d he told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware.His remarks came after he scored a win over Trump in Wisconsin, closing off one of the president\u2019s best routes to re-election.Trump\u2019s campaign said it is suing in Pennsylvania and Michigan to halt vote counts that have been trending toward Biden.Trump falsely declared victory in Pennsylvania, one of the six states that has yet to be called by the Associated Press. The president was ahead in the state by 383,000 votes but Pennsylvania officials said more than a million ballots still have to be counted.Trump faces a more difficult path to victory. Trump would have to win all the battleground states that have not yet been called.Biden\u2019s Wisconsin and Michigan victories reverse Trump\u2019s upsets in 2016 when he defeated Hillary Clinton.Trump\u2019s campaign said it would demand a recount in Wisconsin, where the candidates were less than 1 percentage point apart.Biden\u2019s campaign said it expects to be able to declare overall victory Wednesday afternoon, sooner than many expected.Election officials continued to count votes in several battleground states as Democrats, whose expectations for a \u201cblue wave\u201d were dashed.Trump tweeted throughout the day casting doubt on the count of mail-in ballots, which were heavily Democratic, after the Election Day in-person votes were counted, which leaned Republican.\u201cHow come every time they count Mail-In ballot dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction,\u201d the president said on Twitter. Another tweet mused about his leads \u201cmagically\u201d disappearing in states run by Democratic governors.Bill Stepien, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, insisted the president was headed for re-election and that the campaign was readying its lawyers to challenge results in some states.In a middle-of-the-night speech from the White House, Trump threatened to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene to stop what he called the disenfranchisement of Republican voters, without offering evidence that any wrongdoing had occurred.\u201cFrankly, we did win this election,\u201d Trump said, noting that he held a lead in a number of states where results were still uncertain. \u201cSo we\u2019ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear what Trump meant, as states including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada were counting legally cast votes. It is routine for states to continue counting votes after Election Day, and Pennsylvania said results likely wouldn\u2019t be finalized for several days.U.S. stocks held onto their gains after the news, led by technology shares, on speculation that a split Congress would ensure the extension of key elements of the bull market, such as Trump\u2019s 2017 corporate tax cuts. Treasuries also rallied.The unresolved outcome -- due to an unusually large number of mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus -- risks stoking tensions further in the U.S., beset by an economic downturn and the raging virus.But the Biden campaign was optimistic of the outcome and slammed Trump\u2019s efforts to halt vote counting.\u201cWhen all of the votes are tallied, we are confident that Vice President Joe Biden will be the next president of the United States,\u201d said Biden campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon.O\u2019Malley Dillon said in a statement early Wednesday that Trump\u2019s remarks were \u201coutrageous, unprecedented and incorrect\u201d and \u201ca naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens.\u201dIn Nevada, where tallying was halted until Thursday, Biden was clinging to a lead of almost 8,000 votes. In the nationwide popular vote, Biden leads by roughly 2 million.There were few surprises among states where the Associated Press announced winners, with Republican and Democratic states generally falling in line, despite expectations for several upsets.Trump won Florida, a crucial prize in the race to the White House that closed off Biden\u2019s hopes for an early knockout in the election. The president also won Texas, which Democrats had hoped might flip and entirely reshape the electoral map.Trump won Ohio and Biden won Minnesota, states that each candidate had sought to take from the other but wound up politically unchanged from 2016.Trump still holds small leads in North Carolina and Georgia, though there are votes outstanding in each. Trump won both states in 2016.In addition to Wisconsin, Biden won Nebraska\u2019s second congressional district, Minnesota, Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, New York, Virginia, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Mexico, Delaware, District of Columbia and New Hampshire, according to the AP.Trump won Nebraska\u2019s other four Electoral College votes, Ohio, Florida, Texas, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, West Virginia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Missouri.Nebraska is one of only two states, with Maine, that award an Electoral College vote to the winner of each congressional district. Trump won two districts and Biden won one. Trump won the state overall, giving him Nebraska\u2019s two remaining Electoral College votes.Trump won Maine\u2019s second congressional district and Biden won the first, plus the state\u2019s two at-large electoral votes.Even if Democrats yet claim the White House, a wave of support they hoped would also give them control of both chambers of Congress may fall short.Democrats would need to win three of the five Senate seats still undecided to leave the Senate with a 50-50 split, which would leave the party in the White House in control.Biden\u2019s lead appears to be thanks to holding onto Latino and African-American voters in numbers similar to what Clinton had four years ago. And he narrowed Trump\u2019s margin among White voters, voter surveys from the AP show.Trump had a 12-point lead among White voters in Tuesday\u2019s election. Network exit polls four years ago showed him with a 20-point advantage among those voters. Biden led among Latino voters 30 points, Black voters by 82 points, and women by 12 points.(Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, provided $100 million in support of Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris in Florida, half of that from his Independence USA PAC.)(Corrects ninth paragraph to remove language about the first Republican wins in Michigan and Wisconsin.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/trump-biden-election-fight-may-130319493.html","source":"Yahoo | Business Finance","image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/zf3NeAYh7vCOCfb2lSV6AA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/bloomberg_markets_842\/5630e43a0b458d7c132bb1643cd6158f","category":"business","language":"en","country":"us","published_at":"2020-11-04T22:30:39+00:00"},{"author":null,"title":"2020 elections: 5 states pass legal marijuana measures, potentially growing industry by $9 billion","description":"The once widely controversial issue of marijuana legalization has been decidedly eclipsed by this year\u2019s divisive presidential race, though voters in five states broadly adopted legalization measures Tuesday.\u00a0","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/2020-elections-marijuana-on-the-ballot-in-these-5-states-173753954.html","source":"Yahoo | Business Finance","image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/YxF2SMzJmiveoR4jLxQb4A--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-\/https:\/\/media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2020-11\/a1dd3370-1dfa-11eb-bd7b-ca2d9f3a49e3","category":"business","language":"en","country":"us","published_at":"2020-11-04T14:26:04+00:00"},{"author":null,"title":"Elections 2020: Stock futures whipsawed as election outcome hangs in balance","description":"Stock futures fluctuated between gains and losses early Wednesday morning as investors took in the flow of results for the 2020 election, which has so far produced no clear signs of a victor of the White House.","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/election-2020-stock-market-news-updates-november-4-2020-100242013.html","source":"Yahoo | Business Finance","image":"http:\/\/l2.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kZZMWpZvCEZdnQzXdVDRZA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-\/https:\/\/media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2020-11\/ca73c5e0-1e1a-11eb-a3ff-606cede991e0","category":"business","language":"en","country":"us","published_at":"2020-11-04T13:27:35+00:00"},{"author":null,"title":"Elections 2020: Stock futures whipsawed as election outcome hangs in balance","description":"Stock futures fluctuated between gains and losses early Wednesday morning as investors took in the flow of results for the 2020 election, which has so far produced no clear signs of a victor of the White House.","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/election-2020-stock-market-news-updates-november-4-2020-100242013.html","source":"Yahoo | Business Finance","image":"http:\/\/l2.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kZZMWpZvCEZdnQzXdVDRZA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-\/https:\/\/media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2020-11\/ca73c5e0-1e1a-11eb-a3ff-606cede991e0","category":"business","language":"en","country":"us","published_at":"2020-11-04T11:57:07+00:00"},{"author":null,"title":"Elections 2020: Stock futures whipsawed as election outcome hangs in balance","description":"Stock futures fluctuated between gains and losses early Wednesday morning as investors took in the flow of results for the 2020 election, which has so far produced no clear signs of a victor of the White House.","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/election-2020-stock-market-news-updates-november-4-2020-100242013.html","source":"Yahoo | Business Finance","image":"http:\/\/l2.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/kZZMWpZvCEZdnQzXdVDRZA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-\/https:\/\/media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2020-11\/ca73c5e0-1e1a-11eb-a3ff-606cede991e0","category":"business","language":"en","country":"us","published_at":"2020-11-04T11:37:33+00:00"},{"author":null,"title":"Trump falsely claims election win and says he wants \u2018all voting to stop\u2019 as Biden calls for \u2018patience\u2019","description":"In an extraordinary late-night address on Wednesday, President Trump baselessly said he had won reelection despite the race being too close to call.

Nasdaq 100 futures surged almost 4% at one point, triggering an exchange-mandated two-minute trading pause, before trimming the gain to less than 3%. The dollar was also on a roller-coaster ride, surging as much as 1% before settling for a gain of 0.2%. Treasury yields slumped plunged, with the 10-year benchmark down to 0.82%.President Donald Trump has an early lead in several contested battleground states that would be key to his re-election chances, while challenger Joe Biden is turning to the Midwest for support in his bid to take the White House. The race for control of the Senate remains up in the air.\u201cEverything flipped, just like in \u201816, and it seems like it could be a very large Trump win, which means no contested election -- and that\u2019s what the market wants,\u201d said Scott Bauer, chief executive officer at Prosper Trading Academy. \u201cThey just don\u2019t want this to drag on.\u201dMarkets have been volatile during the final weeks of the campaign as investors fretted over the potential for a contested outcome, a surge in coronavirus cases and stretched valuations that make megacap tech shares look expensive as the economic rebound starts to slow. The S\u0026P 500 has moved at least 1% six of the past seven sessions.While Biden\u2019s solid lead in polls had some investors speculating there would be a relatively quick decision on who will prevail, a surge in mail-in ballots has made it more likely that some states won\u2019t be able to declare a winner Tuesday. That exposes markets to a drawn out process for determining the next president.Adding to anxiety is that markets haven\u2019t always been prescient in knowing what outcome they\u2019d prefer. In 2016, Trump\u2019s perceived recklessness was considered bad news for a stock market that detests uncertainty. Futures plunged the maximum 5% as he took the lead late on Nov. 8, 2016. By morning, as investors warmed to his pledges of cutting taxes and slashing regulations, futures had rebounded higher. The S\u0026P 500 has rallied 57% since his surprise win.Investors have come around on Biden as his lead solidified, banking on his promise to broker a massive aid package to jumpstart the economy hit by the pandemic. Assets seen benefiting most from a Biden administration have climbed alongside his polling lead. The Invesco Solar ETF, ticker TAN, has surged over 140% in the past six months, buoyed by optimism that Biden would boost infrastructure and green-energy spending.Hopes of a multi-trillion fiscal aid package has boosted benchmark Treasury yields to the highest level since June, dragging beaten-down shares of financial companies higher as well. Meanwhile, the Nomura-Wolfe Biden Election Basket -- a group of stocks that wagers on potential winners from a Democratic victory while betting against shares seen as losers -- climbed to a record on Monday. The basket holds 30 pair trades across sectors including technology, health care, utilities and others.But not all outcomes under Biden are considered market-friendly. He also has pledged to roll back the huge tax cuts that Trump handed corporate America back in 2017, a move that, irrespective of the public-policy merits it may have, at least has the potential to create stress for equities. Democrats have also promised tighter financial regulation and will look at how megacap tech companies operate.Another possibility is that a Biden win is not accompanied by Democrats taking over control of the Senate, leaving Congress divided. That could temper expectations for a spending bill and threaten to stall much of Biden\u2019s platform.The S\u0026P 500 retreated in both September and October after a torrid summer rally. It closed Tuesday about 6% below its all-time high.While trades reflecting a Democratic sweep held firm, betting markets aren\u2019t convinced. One gauge slipped to just over 50% odds of the so-called Blue Wave -- that Democrats oust Trump and take Congressional majorities. Traders hedged prospects of post-vote volatility, driving a measure of expected swings in China\u2019s yuan to its highest level in more than nine years.\u201cThe closer the race is, the bigger the risk is,\u201d said Erika Karp, founder and CEO of Cornerstone Capital Group. \u201cA close outcome is a risk to the market.

While neither side disclosed details of what was discussed, people familiar with the matter said Ant\u2019s leadership team was told the company will face increased scrutiny and be subject to restrictions on capital and leverage similar to banks.Investors have long understood that Ant would fall under new Chinese regulations on financial conglomerates, but the meeting may nonetheless temper the frenzy surrounding history\u2019s biggest stock-market debut. Ant is due to start trading on Thursday after raising at least $34.5 billion in an IPO that attracted more than $3 trillion of orders from retail investors in Shanghai and Hong Kong.\u201cRegulatory risks are the biggest risk factor for Ant Group,\u201d Kevin Kwek, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a note. \u201cWe think the news will only be incrementally negative to the listing and believe most investors will remain optimistic on Ant\u2019s positive long term prospects. Investors might nevertheless revisit their assumptions of growth given the clear signs of regulatory intervention.\u201dAnt Chairman Eric Jing and Chief Executive Simon Hu joined Ma at the meeting, which included the banking watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, according to a CSRC statement on Weibo. Ant said in a statement it will \u201cimplement the meeting opinions in depth\u201d and follow guidelines including stable innovation, an embrace of supervision and service to the real economy.The central bank, banking regulator and CSRC weren\u2019t able to provide additional comment outside regular business hours.Ant has been hit with a wave of fresh rules in recent months as China tightens control over online lenders and companies that operate multiple financial business lines. These have included capital and licensing requirements, a cap on loan rates and limits on Ant\u2019s use of asset-backed securities to fund quick consumer loans. On Monday, the banking regulator released draft rules that would force Ant and other operators of online lending platforms to fund a greater share of the loans they offer together with banks.Good InnovationThe Hangzhou-based company, a 2010 offshoot of Chinese giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., dominates China\u2019s payments market via the Alipay app. It also runs the giant Yu\u2019ebao money market fund and two of the country\u2019s largest consumer lending platforms. Other businesses include a credit scoring unit and an insurance marketplace.Ant has faced censure in Chinese state media after Ma last month criticized local and global regulators for stifling innovation and not paying sufficient heed to development and opportunities for the young. He compared the Basel Accords, which set out capital requirements for banks, to a club for the elderly.\u201cGood innovation is not afraid of regulation, but is afraid of outdated regulation,\u201d he told a Shanghai conference. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t use the way to manage a train station to regulate an airport, neither should we regulate the future with the method from yesterday.\u201dGuo Wuping, head of consumer protection at the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, wrote in commentary on Monday that Ant\u2019s Huabei consumer lending service was similar to a credit card but with higher charges. Fintech companies use their market power to set exorbitant fees in partnerships with banks, which provide most of the funds required, he wrote.Ant, which has more than 700 million monthly Alipay users, has made partnering with traditional banks a centerpiece of its strategy. Its lending platforms extended credit to about 500 million people in the 12 months through June, charging annualized rates on its smaller loans of about 15%.About 2% of the 1.7 trillion yuan ($254 billion) of loans it facilitated as of June were currently on its balance sheet, the company said in its prospectus.New measures proposed by the banking regulator on Monday for online lenders included imposing a cap on the amount of loans to be offered to individual borrowers as well as the leverage.The draft rules could deal a major blow to Ant as they require platform operators to provide at least 30% of the funding for loans. The company declined to comment on the proposed measures.Investors\u2019 response to the fresh regulatory scrutiny will become clearer when Ant debuts on Thursday, but for now they appear to be taking the news mostly in stride. Alibaba, which owns about a third of Ant, rose 2% in New York on Monday. Ant maintained early gains in the so-called gray market in Hong Kong, where shares were said to be trading at a 50% premium to the HK$80 listing price on Monday.(Updates with details throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/jack-ma-summoned-china-financial-143218306.html","source":"Yahoo | Business Finance","image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/jGUZ0NzdMiJCrdNF6c0S0g--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/bloomberg_markets_842\/2e389419393ea1f1b29de0cc70160d20","category":"business","language":"en","country":"us","published_at":"2020-11-03T01:36:09+00:00"},{"author":null,"title":"Polls show Biden leading Trump on election eve, but race tightening in key battlegrounds","description":"According to the final batch of major national and state polls, the former vice president is holding a modest but distinct lead over the incumbent president.

The gauge fell again last week, dropping 5.6% ahead of the presidential election Tuesday amid lingering concerns of a drawn-out or contested result.U.S. stock futures fluctuated Monday as investors braced for a volatile week that spans the election and its aftermath as well as a Federal Reserve policy meeting. S\u0026P 500 contracts advanced 0.3% as of 7:55 a.m. in London.The benchmark equity gauge ended at 3,269.96 on Friday, down a little under 9% from its record close on Sept. 2.Some strategists argue the S\u0026P 500 can make a run higher from next year, helped by post-election progress on government aid to combat the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout, as well as the introduction of treatments and vaccines.For instance, BTIG LLC chief equity and derivatives strategist Julian Emanuel wrote in a note that the firm\u2019s base case is \u201ceventual new all-time highs when the correction concludes\u201d possibly in the first quarter of 2021.Technical analysts are sounding some notes of caution. Strategists Jason Hunter and Alix Tepper Floman of JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co. said the S\u0026P 500 is revisiting a \u201ccluster of support\u201d surrounding the 3,200 level.Should there be a sustained break below that, it \u201ccould accelerate the price weakness and create a more aggressive flight-to-quality flow\u201d that could take the index down to the 2,950-3,050 area, they wrote in a note.(Updates with stock futures in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/speculators-boost-bullish-u-stock-053831081.html","source":"Yahoo | Business Finance","image":"http:\/\/l.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/CsNVh56.cPcldT1DxClQpg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/bloomberg_markets_842\/e5d53401c7cf1f6b56bd1c7a73400432","category":"business","language":"en","country":"us","published_at":"2020-11-02T08:00:43+00:00"},{"author":null,"title":"These Are the Airlines Teetering on the Brink of Covid Ruin","description":"(Bloomberg) -- Having a home government with deep -- and open -- pockets is emerging as key in terms of whether an airline will make it through the coronavirus pandemic.Carriers in jurisdictions where there is scant support from up high are most likely to go bust, according to an analysis by Bloomberg News. Using the Z-score method developed by Edward Altman in the 1960s to predict bankruptcies, Bloomberg sifted through available data on listed commercial airlines to identify the ones most prone to financial strife.Versus the same analysis done in March, when the virus was just starting to spread beyond China into parts of Asia and Europe, rapidly cutting off international travel, the results show a clear swing to the West. At least four of the 10 airlines named back then have restructured in some fashion, and all but one were in Asia.The list now is populated more by carriers in Africa and Latin America, where some have already folded or entered administration. Representatives from Medview Airlines Plc, Precision Air Services Ltd., Grupo Aeromexico SAB and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests seeking comment.AirAsia Group Bhd. and Azul SA declined to comment. Thai Airways International Pcl said a reorganization plan will be proposed to the Central Bankruptcy Court by the end of the year, and noted the company plans to fulfill its commitments to all creditors.A spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines Corp. said while data may show the airline\u2019s liabilities exceed assets by around four times, \u201cin reality it\u2019s different because those liabilities are extended on sovereign guarantees and servicing is done through the government budget. In that sense, the situation isn\u2019t as it shows. Pakistan International has been managing on its resources. We\u2019re comparatively doing okay.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say Asia is out of the woods. AirAsia X Bhd., AirAsia\u2019s long-haul budget arm, is restructuring more than $15 billion of debt and the future of state-run Malaysia Airlines Bhd. remains uncertain. The director of aviation development at the Malaysian Aviation Commission, Germal Singh, said recently the government is unlikely to intervene to help out.Cash BurnIn Latin America, Grupo Aeromexico SAB last month received a $1 billion bankruptcy loan, while Colombia\u2019s largest airline, Avianca Holdings SA, is awaiting court approval for a $2 billion financing plan as it reorganizes under Chapter 11. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has ruled out bailouts for large companies, while a Colombian court in September temporarily blocked a $370 million government loan to Avianca after a citizen expressed concern about a lack of guarantees.That\u2019s in contrast to some parts of Asia. Although Singapore Airlines Ltd. has cut around 20% of its workforce, it\u2019s raised S$11 billion ($8 billion) from loans and a rights issue supported by state investor Temasek Holdings Pte. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., which has also slashed jobs, raised billions of dollars in a restructuring in June that resulted in the Hong Kong government getting a stake and two observer seats on its board.\u201cMany governments have done a good job in financially supporting aviation jobs,\u201d International Air Transport Association Director General Alexandre de Juniac said last month. \u201cWhere this has not happened -- in Latin America for example -- we see bankruptcies. Airlines continue to burn through cash and that is expected to persist into next year. Without a second tranche of financial aid, many airlines will not make it through the winter.\u201dThe Z-score method uses five variables measuring liquidity, solvency, profitability, leverage and recent financial performance. The model has an accuracy rate of between 80% and 90% the year prior to insolvency, Altman said in a 2018 interview. A score below 1.8 indicates danger of bankruptcy within two years while a number closer to 3 suggests a company is on solid ground.Among those airlines found to be most vulnerable in March were Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. and Thai budget carrier Nok Airlines Pcl. Virgin Australia is now going through an A$3.5 billion ($2.5 billion) restructuring under its new owner Bain Capital LP, while Nok Air has applied to the nation\u2019s Central Bankruptcy Court to undergo debt rehabilitation.Fresh WavesAlarmingly, the coronavirus outbreak shows little sign of abating. Global cases exceed 46 million as new waves sweep across Europe and the U.S., sending many cities back into partial lockdown. Deaths are nearing 1.2 million. Several vaccine trials have suffered setbacks and any effective jab may be months away.IATA, in a new analysis released last week, said total industry revenues next year are expected to be down 46% on 2019\u2019s $838 billion. Without additional government financial relief, the median airline has just 8.5 months of cash remaining at current burn rates.While some places -- in Asia, notably Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand -- are toying with travel bubbles, IATA has said thorough Covid-19 testing is the only way to get the aviation industry back on its feet. But that idea is yet to gain widespread traction given the elusiveness of the virus, which typically has a two-week incubation period.Read more: IATA Says Airlines Working With WHO on Testing to Replace QuarantineAt stake are plane orders worth hundreds of billions of dollars with Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. Both manufacturers are facing scores of scheduled deliveries that may be deferred, or worse, canceled.On average, there\u2019s a 12.6% chance that airlines may cancel or defer planned deliveries from Airbus, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence, which arrived at the number based on the five-year default probability of airlines or their parents. The situation is worse for Boeing, which faces an average 14% risk for its orders, with American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. most likely to revisit their plans.As many as 900 planes each at Boeing and Airbus are from unidentified customers and failed airlines and aren\u2019t given any risk rating, BI analysts led by George Ferguson wrote in an Oct. 10 report. Airlines undergoing restructuring, like Avianca and Latam Airlines Group SA for Airbus, and Aeromexico and Virgin Australia for Boeing, pose the biggest cancellation risk.\u201cThe worst isn\u2019t behind any airline,\u201d said Akbar Al Baker, chief executive officer of Qatar Airways Ltd., which has already received $2 billion in state aid. \u201cAirlines need to be supported by their governments to survive.\u201d(Updates with comment from Pakistan International in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/airlines-teetering-brink-covid-ruin-210000548.html","source":"Yahoo | Business Finance","image":"http:\/\/l2.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/3pJGg9NPBhPhSL5JqgO7vg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/bloomberg_markets_842\/9f9089bb477078e26ca3e143e3489273","category":"business","language":"en","country":"us","published_at":"2020-11-02T06:07:50+00:00"},{"author":null,"title":"Trump\u2019s vaccine promises meet reality","description":"President Trump\u2019s optimistic promises that a vaccine for COVID-19 would be ready either before the election or by the end of the year seem increasingly unlikely to be fulfilled.","url":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/trumps-vaccine-promises-meet-reality-184543949.html","source":"Yahoo News","image":"http:\/\/l1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/0u7GZ8csxyWAntjgxwgHAA--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-\/https:\/\/media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2020-10\/53118bb0-197c-11eb-bff5-7a632ba6487e","category":"politics","language":"en","country":"us","published_at":"2020-10-29T18:45:43+00:00"},{"author":null,"title":"U.S. Stocks Set for Rebound After Worst Selloff in Four Months","description":"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. index futures are pointing to a rebound for equities at the open on Wall Street after concerns over tougher coronavirus-related lockdowns yesterday fueled the S\u0026P 500 Index\u2019s worst decline in more than four months.S\u0026P 500 contracts expiring in December were up 0.9% as of 8:10 a.m. in London, after earlier rising as much as 1.5%.

Germany is proposing widespread curbs for a month, while France is preparing tougher restrictions that may include a lockdown in the latest round of measures to limit the spread of Covid-19. That weighed on European and U.S. equity markets, while the dollar was stronger, souring oil market sentiment.Adding to the gloom, the American Petroleum Institute reported crude inventories expanded by 4.58 million barrels last week, while gasoline stockpiles rose for a second straight week, according to people familiar with the data. Official government figures are due later on Wednesday.Crude has come under renewed pressure as the virus leads to a more fragile demand outlook, and the head of Saudi Aramco\u2019s trading unit said traders are cautious given the uncertainty in consumption. The market is also facing rising supply from Libya, which is eroding some of the stock draws that were expected in the fourth quarter.

Yet the positive surprise may do little to change the gloomy outlook for Big Oil amid the coronavirus pandemic.While crude prices have recovered from historic lows seen in April, BP\u2019s profit was down 96% from a year earlier as restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus in Europe and the U.S. kept fuel demand at bay. The company warned of a \u201cvolatile and challenging trading environment\u201d where \u201cthe shape and pace of the recovery is uncertain.\u201dBP reported an adjusted net income of $86 million for the third quarter on Tuesday, down from $2.25 billion a year earlier.

With a less volatile market and fewer opportunities for so-called contango plays -- a trade that profits from buying and storing oil during a glut -- the unit\u2019s earnings were \u201csignificantly lower,\u201d the company said.Other oil majors, who report later this week, have already told investors they experienced the same headwinds as BP. \u201cRefining margins are absolutely terrible,\u201d Patrick Pouyanne, Total SE\u2019s chief executive officer, said earlier this month. Royal Dutch Shell Plc warned that its trading performance will be \u201cbelow average\u201d in the third quarter.One positive sign for BP was a drop in net debt to $40.4 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from $46.5 billion a year earlier. After cutting the dividend in August, reducing debt is necessary to give investors confidence that the payout is now sustainable.\u201cFunding the dividend remains our first priority and we are confident in moving toward our $35 billion net-debt target,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss said in the statement.

Taiwan\u2019s presidential office thanked the U.S for the sale.

Following the completion of the deal, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and CK Hutchison Holdings, the conglomerate he founded and Husky\u2019s biggest shareholder, will together own about 27% of Cenovus.Like most of their industry peers, Cenovus and Husky are currently losing money following the crash in oil demand due to the pandemic. But even before the devastating impact of Covid-19, the Alberta oil sands had already lost their luster due to a chronic lack of pipeline capacity to export crude. That has forced producers there to accept hefty price discounts.Husky shareholders will receive 0.7845 of a Cenovus share and 0.0651 of a Cenovus share purchase warrant in exchange for each Husky common share.That represents a 21% deal premium, excluding the warrants. The takeover is valued at C$23.6 billion when debt is included.The oil sands also face increased environmental scrutiny arising from their carbon intensity, which makes the deposits more polluting to exploit than conventional reserves or shale. International oil majors including Norway\u2019s Equinor ASA, France\u2019s Total SA and Houston-based ConocoPhillips have either left or reduced their presence in Canada in recent years.Debt ProblemsCenovus\u2019s purchase of Conoco\u2019s oil sands assets in 2017 left the Calgary-based company with heavy debts, magnifying its exposure to tumbling Canadian heavy oil prices. Its shares have fallen 72% since the deal was announced and 75% over five years. Husky\u2019s shares are down 85% over five years.Buying Husky will boost Cenovus\u2019s production to about 750,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent from about 475,000 now. But perhaps more importantly, it will gain substantial downstream assets, namely additional refinery and pipeline capacity.That will equip Cenovus to refine and upgrade 70% of its crude at its own refineries. The company says that will leave it less exposed to Western Canada Select, the local benchmark price, which usually trades at a discount of more than $10 a barrel to West Texas Intermediate, partly because of pipeline constraints.\u2018More Resilient\u2019The merged company will be cash-flow positive \u201cright out the gate,\u201d Cenovus Chief Executive Officer Alex Pourbaix said in an interview. According to the statement announcing the deal, the company will break-even at $36 a barrel for WTI crude. That\u2019s seen falling to $33 by 2023. WTI closed Friday at $39.85.\u201cThe combined entity is far more resilient,\u201d Husky CEO Robert Peabody said in the interview. \u201cWe will deleverage faster.\u201dCenovus, which is rated Ba2 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, aims to be an investment-grade borrower, executives said during a call with analysts Sunday. The company said the deal will help it create an \u201caccelerated path\u201d to cutting debt to less than two times Ebitda within 24 months.\u201cNobody should be surprised if non-core assets are sold,\u201d Pourbaix said in the interview. Husky\u2019s retail business, which includes gas stations and travel centers across most of Canada, is a division \u201cwe will take a look at.\u201dCenovus and Husky started their \u201con-and-off again\u201d merger discussions during the pandemic, with a more concentrated effort to reach an agreement over the last couple of months, Pourbaix said.The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, after which Cenovus will have about C$12 billion in net debt and C$8.5 billion in committed credit facilities from a broad banking syndicate.It\u2019s the largest deal in the Canadian oil industry since Husky\u2019s attempted C$2.75 billion hostile takeover bid for MEG Energy Corp. Husky abandoned that transaction in January 2019 after failing to win enough shareholder support.U.S. DealsThe C$1.2 billion in savings comprise C$600 million from reduced capital spending and C$600 million in corporate and operating cost cuts, including job reductions. Cenovus will continue to operate under that name, with its headquarters remaining in Calgary.The tie-up also follows a recent flurry of oil and gas deals south of the border that\u2019s shaking up the U.S. shale industry. Just last week, ConocoPhillips agreed to buy Concho Resources Inc. for $9.7 billion takeover and Pioneer Natural Resources Co. agreed to acquire Parsley Energy Inc. for $4.5 billion. EQT Corp., the biggest producer of U.S. natural gas, is also seeking to acquire rival CNX Resources Corp., people familiar with the matter said last week.RBC Capital Markets and TD Securities are Cenovus\u2019s financial advisers on the deal and Bennett Jones LLP and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton \u0026 Garrison LLP are its legal advisers. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and CIBC Capital Markets are Husky\u2019s financial advisers and Osler, Hoskin \u0026 Harcourt LLP and Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP are its legal advisers.(Corrects spelling of typographical error in headline)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/cenovus-energy-combine-husky-23-115745760.html","source":"Yahoo | Business Finance","image":"http:\/\/l1.yimg.com\/uu\/api\/res\/1.2\/C3abOGQfwdB82EwnVp.tDg--\/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/bloomberg_markets_842\/c6aa70c6c96a82a6a707b6e0a08f9892","category":"business","language":"en","country":"us","published_at":"2020-10-25T19:46:58+00:00"},{"author":null,"title":"The U.S. has held an election during a pandemic before.
