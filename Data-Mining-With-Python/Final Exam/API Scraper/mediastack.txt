Follow all the latest news and updates, liveInvasion Day 2021 rally and protest eventsGrace Tame named 2021 Australian of the YearState-by-state restrictions and lockdown rules explained 9.39pm GMT Prime minister Scott Morrison was on 2GB earlier this morning and repeated his like that 26 January is \u201cnot a day to focus\u201d on differences and disagreements in Australian society.Given that celebrating Australia on 26 January is one of the foundational disagreements in this country, this dictate may not be heeded.Of course there are many controversial issues ... and things around this day but today it\u2019s a day just to come together ... be thankful for being Australian.Regardless of what our stories are, our experiences, our differences or disagreements that may happen, today is not a day to focus on that.I can\u2019t pretend it won\u2019t be but we\u2019ll come through it the same way we always do - together. 9.29pm GMT Meanwhile, Sydney artist Scott Marsh has unveiled a new mural. 9.25pm GMT Scott Morrison also wrote an opinion piece on Australia Day which was published in The Australian this morning, in which he said Australia had \u201crisen above\u201d its history and that there was \u201cno escaping or cancelling\u201d the significance of 26 January, 1788, in Australia\u2019s history.An interesting approach for someone who is calling for an end to division.Today, on Australia Day we reflect on that journey, the price that has been paid for our freedom, the lessons of our history and the privilege of being able to call ourselves Australians.We do it on the day when the course of this land changed forever. We do this, because in Australia we believe in the unique value of each Australian as individuals, rather than seeing or indeed allowing ourselves to be defined solely through the identity prism of our age, race, gender, ethnicity or religion. As Australians we are more than any and all of these things, and together we share and steward our Australian inheritance. 9.17pm GMT Prime minister Scott Morrison will attend the Australia Day national flag raising ceremony and a citizenship ceremony in Canberra at 9am. 9.17pm GMT The dawn service memorialises those killed in massacres in Victoria.Guardian Australia worked with the University of Newcastle to share the stories of massacres that occurred on the Australian frontier, and well behind the frontier, from 1788 to 1928.  Related: The killing times: a massacre map of Australia\u0027s frontier wars  9.11pm GMT The Invasion Day dawn service has wrapped up in Melbourne. The event began in 2019 and looks a bit different this year.Most of these changes are to ensure the event complies with Covid-safe rules.  9.03pm GMT Legal services have provided information for people attending Invasion Day rallies in Sydney and Melbourne, where police have said they will enforce Covid-19 public health rules.The Covid-19 rules cap the number of people at a protest at 500 people in Sydney, and public outdoor gatherings at 100 people in Melbourne. Protest organisers are trying to hold the events to comply with those rules \u2013 in Melbourne, for example, protesters have been told to organise in groups of 100, and keep ten metres apart from the next group of 100.The NSW Police Minister has flagged that fines and possible prison sentences will apply if tomorrow\u0027s #InvasionDay protest exceeds 500 people. Here is some general information on what to do if you are approached by police. Please stay safe.

Health experts have stated that the risk of community transmission of Covid-19 is currently low, but that people attending a protest should take precautions. 8.47pm GMT Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical Prof Michael Kidd has been on Radio National talking about the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines. The Therapeutic Goods Administration approved the Pfizer vaccine for use in Australia yesterday.When the vaccine arrives in the country the Therapeutic Goods Administration does its usual work looking at the batches which arrive to make sure that everything is as it should be, and then within two weeks of vaccine arriving in the country we should start to see the vaccine rolling out. Initially within those 30-50 hubs that are being set up around Australia to deliver the initial doses of the vaccine.We hope the first doses of the vaccine will be delivered late in February. At the moment we don\u2019t know exactly how long it is going to take to get the first 10m doses just that it will happen throughout the course of 2021. 8.32pm GMT Good morning,It\u2019s 26 January, a day in which Australians either celebrate Australia Day, recognise as Invasion Day, a day of mourning, and march to abolish Australia Day, or don\u2019t celebrate at all. Here I ask you to remember that I am a rape victim, so you can only imagine the horror, the screams, the degrading feeling, the absolute fear and shame I was experiencing \u2026 as well as the grief and despair, disappointment of not being able to attend my grandmother\u2019s funeral.
